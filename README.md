This is for the New Node class of 2023


Node.js is an open-source, server-side runtime environment that allows you to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It is built on the Chrome V8 JavaScript engine and provides a platform for building scalable and high-performance network applications. Node.js is often used to create web servers and other network-related applications, but it can also be used for various other purposes, such as building command-line tools and desktop applications.
