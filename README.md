# NODE-PRO-2023-CLASS
This is for the New Node class of 2023


Node.js is an open-source, server-side runtime environment that allows you to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It is built on the Chrome V8 JavaScript engine and provides a platform for building scalable and high-performance network applications. Node.js is often used to create web servers and other network-related applications, but it can also be used for various other purposes, such as building command-line tools and desktop applications.

Here are some key features and concepts associated with Node.js:

Non-blocking and Asynchronous: Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which means that it can handle many concurrent connections without blocking the execution of other code. This makes it well-suited for building real-time applications like chat applications, online games, and streaming services.
Package Management: Node.js has a package manager called npm (Node Package Manager), which is one of the largest and most active package ecosystems in the world. Developers can easily install and manage third-party libraries and modules using npm.
Single-threaded Event Loop: Node.js applications are single-threaded, but they can efficiently handle many concurrent connections because of their event loop mechanism. The event loop allows Node.js to execute I/O operations asynchronously and efficiently.
Modules: Node.js uses a module system that allows you to organize your code into reusable and encapsulated components. Built-in modules provide functionality for various tasks like file I/O, networking, and working with the file system.
Cross-Platform: Node.js is cross-platform and runs on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
V8 Engine: Node.js leverages the V8 JavaScript engine, which is also used in Google Chrome. This engine compiles JavaScript into machine code, resulting in fast execution.
Community and Ecosystem: Node.js has a vibrant and active developer community, which means that there are a vast number of libraries, frameworks, and tools available for building a wide range of applications.

Node.js is commonly used in conjunction with web frameworks like Express.js to create web servers and RESTful APIs, but it can be applied to various types of projects, from serverless functions to desktop applications using frameworks like Electron.

To work with Node.js, you need to install it on your system, 
        
        npm init -y
        and follow the other processes by
        npm i ejs, express,
and you can start writing JavaScript code using the Node.js runtime environment.
