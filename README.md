# NODE-PRO-2023-CLASS
This is for the New Node class of 2023


Node.js is an open-source, server-side runtime environment that allows you to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It is built on the Chrome V8 JavaScript engine and provides a platform for building scalable and high-performance network applications. Node.js is often used to create web servers and other network-related applications, but it can also be used for various other purposes, such as building command-line tools and desktop applications.

Here are some key features and concepts associated with Node.js:

Non-blocking and Asynchronous: Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which means that it can handle many concurrent connections without blocking the execution of other code. This makes it well-suited for building real-time applications like chat applications, online games, and streaming services.
Package Management: Node.js has a package manager called npm (Node Package Manager), which is one of the largest and most active package ecosystems in the world. Developers can easily install and manage third-party libraries and modules using npm.
